# Gulp 3 to Gulp 4

Towards the end of 2018, Gulp 4 became the default version installed with

```
npm install gulp
```

which is incompatible with Gulp 3 Gulpfiles.

This repository is a reference for converting a minimal Gulp 3 Gulpfile to a
Gulp 4 Gulpfile. It is accompanied by a blog post.

The environment I wrote this used Node.js v10 & npm v6.
